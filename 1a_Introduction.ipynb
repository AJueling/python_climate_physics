    "Their contents are grouped into cells that can be executed independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook files (`.ipynb`) are human-readable text files, but they need to be opened with a program that can connect it to an active Python kernel.\n",
    "We will use the `Jupyterlab` app or the Jupyter `Notebook` app.\n",
    "You can start those either in the terminal (MacOS/Linux) or the Anaconda prompt (Windows) with the commands `jupyterlab` or `jupyter notebook`.\n",
    "Alternatively, if you installed Anaconda, you can use their graphical user interface, the Anaconda Navigator.\n",

    "There are two modes: Edit mode and Command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit mode allows you to type into the cells like a normal text editor(and you will see a blinking cursor). Command mode allows you to edit the notebook as a whole, but not type into individual cells.\n",
    "You can swith from edit to command by pressing `Esc`, and return to edit mode by pressing `Enter` or double clicking on a cell. In the Notebook app, the color bar left of the cell changes between green and blue, depending on the mode."
