    "## 2. Fundemental programming guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Python error messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Python errors can be daunting at first, especially if they are very long. But don;t despair, after some practive you become better at interpreting them and will find aathem helpful in pinning down the problem. The general idea is that Python shows you the steps from the line where you called the offending line all the way down to the line in the file that raised an error. Often, the most important part of the error message is located at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DRY: Don't repeat yourself\n",
    "It is almost always a sign of bad programming if you have to repeat a line several times. It clutters the code and makes the code harder to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### simplify code\n",
    "Instead of writing one huge function, __break your functions down into logical component functions__. This will save you many headaches when hunting for bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### coding style\n",
    "Python is very forgiving towards your code writing style. Just because it runs wihtout errors does not mean is well written, though.\n",
    "How to write good, readable python code is laid out in the __[PEP8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://pep8.org/)__. Read it and try to adhere to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### reuse code\n",
    "Once you have iterated to stable code (and you want to share it across jupyter notebooks), you should put it in a separate `.py` file. You can __import functions from `.py` files__ simply as `from file import function`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defensive programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Defensive programming is a programming philosophy that tries to guard against errors and minimize time spent on solving bugs. The fundamental idea is that of __unit testing__: you break the code into the small into the small steps (functions) and then test whether they give the expected (known) results for simple test cases. One would write a function with known input and output. Unit testing can be automated and this is known as \"continuous integration (CI)\" (integrated in GitHub,for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach works well for traditional software development with fixed goals, but it is not always suited to scientific programming as the goals shift with new knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the principle of defensive programming is still very valuable. A __simple and easy-to-implement version of this defensive philosophy__ can be implemented by using the `assert` statement often (this is not exactly unit testing). It checks whether a statement is true and can raise a custom error."

    "\n",
    "### Open access\n",
    "The traditional publishing business model has been to charge readers for access to articles. This is less than ideal, as the public pays for the research and the results are behind a paywall. This hinders knowledge transfer and there is a growing movement to open access (i.e. make it free) to scientific knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "To publish open access usually costs money, as the publishers cannot earn money with selling the articles/journals. __The Dutch Universities have agreements with all major publishers to cover open access fees.__ Use this!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Licenses\n",
    "If you want to reuse any online content you must check for the license. If there is no license, you are legally not allowed to use it. This is why it's important that you include a license with your code if you want others to reuse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### reproducible code\n",
    "When you publish your results (as a thesis or paper) you must __ensure that your code can reproduce all the results__. In jupyter notebooks you should check whether it runs completely from start to finish __without error__. The code must be documented. Ultimately, the clean version of __your code (and if possible raw data) should be uploaded to a permament repository__ such as [UU's own Yoda system](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/yoda), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [figshare](https://figshare.com/).
